DB release 2013-06-15:
* Part of the data cleanup effort necessary for exploring CRM
  software, there is a new field in the contact management database
  section for adding details in addition to the actual value to a contact
  method (like phone, email, etc).
  .
  This will allow us to keep the data cleaner, by putting ONLY the
  phone number in the "value" field and any additional text, such as
  the emergency contact's name, specific instructions, etc in the new
  separate "details" field.
