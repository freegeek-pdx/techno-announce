I will be incorporating announcements from all of Technocrats in my
weekly(ish) database update mailings to help make everybody more aware
of the projects we work on.

Announcements from Technocrats for the past 2 weeks include:

* Patrick has been given full administrative Technocrat privileges now.
  Congratulations and welcome to the team, Patrick!
* Improved network cabling in laptop build!
* Freegeek Live images generated weekly and available from network boot menus
  and USB/DVD iso images, available on http://r2d2
* Windows now works on all of our network!

I also rolled out one change to the database this morning:

Part of the data cleanup effort necessary for exploring CRM software
required adding a new field in the contact management database section
for adding additional details to a contact method (like phone, email,
etc), such as emergency contact name or instructions.

Existing data has been automatically split. Please help us keep the
data clean by putting ONLY the phone number in the "value" field and
any additional text in the new, separate "details" field.
