== New volunteer milestones report on paidworkers ==

Every Thursday, a report which previously went to inreach regarding
volunteers who pass 100, 200, etc hour totals will be sent to
paidworkers.

== Large files and pictures on the mailing lists ==

We'd like to request that list users and moderators limit use of list
technology when sending large pictures. As they are copied to each
subscribers inbox, this can affect user quota's significantly, taking
up space on our server. Picture files taken directly from a camera can
be scaled to smaller thumbnails using a graphics program like GIMP, or
large images can be linked to on an external website like photobucket.

== New system in sortland ==

There is a new Technocrat maintained system in sortland, freeing bulk
sales to use their laptop as needed.

== RT behavior change: automatically re-opening tickets ==

The automatic logic in RT now opens tickets when either:
* status is new and person acting on the ticket is not requestor
* status is not new/open/pending/contact and the requestor is acting
  on ticket
( by acting, I mean commenting or replying )

Notably, if you add info to a resolved ticket that you did not request,
nothing will happen. I can modify specific queues to behave different.
