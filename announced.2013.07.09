Here are our Technocrat announcements for this week:

* We disabled 24+ inactive RT queues that haven't been used this year,
  cleaning up the list in RT significantly. Please let us know if there
  is any queue that will no longer need to be used.

* There's a new done+XXXXX@todo.freegeek.org alias (replacing XXXXX
  with a ticket number), which will add correspondence to a ticket
  before resolving it automatically

The following changes are being updated on the database LATER today:

* Fixes for some crashes and better reporting in the future

* Contact methods (phone, email, etc) will be sorted in a logical
  order (phone first, and so on)

* For Tech Support intake using shared database users, such as at the
  front desk, a PIN will be necessary now

* When the front desk opens a volunteer that has notes, there will be
  a popup alerting of those notes

* Some reports, such as the volunteer milestone report and income
  report, will provide more detailed information now

* Hopefully, intern badges can be modified to look better as well
