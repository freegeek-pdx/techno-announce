This week's announcements from Technocrats include the following:

* Our email passphrase requirements now allow for higher-security, easier to
  remember passphrases. See https://www.xkcd.com/936/ for an explanation (i.e.
  four randomly chosen words).

  http://mail.freegeek.org/ gives a link to change your email password.

* This week we removed 154 inactive mail accounts from freegeek.org,
  in an effort to reduce old account maintanence burden. Anybody with
  an account who hasn't used it this year no longer has access to it.

Changes to the database this morning include:

* The "Required Service Fee" gizmo type in donations has been broken out
  into 'Required Service Fee - Pickup', 'Required Service Fee - Other',
  'Required Service Fee - Education' & 'Required Service Fee - Tech Support'.

  To reference the TS ticket # on the receipt, it can be added with Ctrl-<e>
  to the standard description field.

* There's a new "shortcut" in the sidebar for adding regular interns

* There's a new streamlined monthly volunteer milestone report

* There is a feature in volunteer events to disable walkins, which
  closes all available shifts (when they become available, too)
