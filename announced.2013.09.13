Sorry if I disrupted people with my later than normal DB
release this morning, I've released the following features:

== Database Stuff ==

There is now a feature for Tech Support to generate an invoice
recording the fees for a work order. This generates a digital
receipt and pre-populates everything for the Front Desk worker.

There is also the ability to override returns for actual refunds,
to allow for better tracking of those rare situations.

The final feature of this morning is our daily income report
automatically generated into the form our new QBE books will
accept it, making less routine work for the bean counters.

== Other Technocrats Stuff ==

Other than the database, the webmail client that is available
at https://mail.freegeek.org is now using a SSL certificate
from a vendor that is better established, making it more secure
to access our email system (with less security warnings).

We also completed the project of removing inactive users from
our email system, removing a final 20 additional users who did
not respond to our mailing, freeing resources for the rest of us.
