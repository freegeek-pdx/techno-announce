Goodmorning Free Geek Staff,

Techno announcements:

== account removal on freegeek.org mail ==

We emailed 27 potentially inactive accounts checking for user
activity. Users may need to click a link to verify their account, or
they can email technocrats@ with any questions.

== OpenVPN fixed: but please use port 1194 ==

I've figured out my mistake (sorry!) with the VPN and it is now
working much better. For future maintainability, we would prefer
users set up on port 1193 to switch to the standard port, 1194.
We run these ports identically in parallel for backwards-compat.

Database announcements (changes happened over the past few days):

== New this morning: contact search splitting (also, org change) ==

When you create a contact in the database after searching for
their name (which is the best proceedure to prevent duplicates),
the database provides options for splitting the name in various
ways now. The previous behavior only worked with a combination
of first and last name, wheras different choices for splitting
the words are now provided (including organization name).

== Related change for organizations (and their name field) ==

* The organization checkbox was replaced with radio buttons,
  still defaulting to Individual but providing two options now

* The organization name field is now always shown, along with
  the first, middle, last name fields for individuals, to
  allow more data to be entered where it makes sense

I did this because many organizations were being entered as
individuals. Please make sure to set a business, non-profit,
government agency, etc to be marked as an "organization".

== New volunteer scheduling mode: TURBO pilot page ==

I am working on optimizing the volunteer schedule to load faster,
including providing a new workflow that will provide less info
(making it load faster, with less cruft for humans to look at).

The "TURBO" mode of the volunteer schedule is still an experiment,
but the concept is to only show available, non-closed slots in all
situations where you are "looking for" a shift to schedule somebody,
limiting to what you are actually looking for with further conditions.

The landing page also provides a contact search box, which will
give you all results for that contact over the next month, allowing
you to quickly check people in or cancel their shift(s).

I am still working on making the code run faster. Please let me
know if you have any suggestions regarding the new workflow!

== More Proper Intern Handling ==

Please add interns by using the "add intern" link available in
the list of rosters/schedules/etc, and be sure to set ther roster
they are a part of to be one of the "Intern" schedules.

== Google Voice Plugin no longer causes data entry errors ==

The Google Voice Plugin had caused some users with it installed
to "lose" contact information entered into the database, replacing
it with HTML gibberish. There is a warning preventing that now.

== Other misc. bug fixes & changes ==

* Monthly reporting metrics can be pulled all at once from the
  database using a new "monthly reports" page (but a few more reports
  must still be added)

* Multiple contact types can be selected for that search condition now

* The "Uncovered LCD monitor" and "System" options were removed from the
  Disbursement Info section of printme spec sheets

* We upgraded our receipt printing applet

* Fixed a bug generating duplicate resources for volskedj events

* Fixed a crash when no value is provided for last logged in condition

* Added upcoming holidays for the next 3 years, to avoid missing them

* The conditions table is more understandable, with better styling to
  keep the field and exclude checkbox closer to the condition name

* The privileges system was refactored for application-wide efficiency

Please let me know if you find any problems.

Thanks,
Ryan
