Today's announcements from Technocrats include the following:

* Roundcube is the new default mail client on mail.freegeek.org,
  the existing address books in SquirrelMail have been sent to
  affected users, but the old interface is still available.

* The database sales interface has the discount field fixed to
  update back to none when switching away from a named contact

* In printme, there's a new system type for 'rendering' systems

* There's a new "Laptop Prebuild" volunteer task type for logging
  hours and vol scheduling. Note that the laptop prebuild shifts
  should not be assigned by the front desk as volunteers must have
  prerequisites checked and complete an application approved by Lynnae.
