Recent changes to our technical infrastructure include:

== Database Income Report: Tracking Tech Support & more ==

The income report now breaks out different service fees from the donor
desk separately as recycling, pickup, tech support, education and
other fees.

Service fees for Pickups, Tech Support, Classes and other non-donation
income can be entered using the "Required Service Fee" gizmo types on
the donations entry screen.

We are working on an interface for tech support to generate an invoice
which will preseed everything besides payment for the front desk.

This new report also tracks Refunds from the store and will be
automatically imported into the new QBE accounting system soon.

== Server Hardware & Technology Upgrade ==

We recently completed our migration from Xen to KVM-based servers, and
upgraded to much more powerful host hardware at the same time. This
will speed up our services!

We have also reached 75% completion for our upgrade to the latest
Debian stable release, well ahead of schedule in my opinion!

== Phone redeployment ==

We were able to run lines for Integra to punch down to nearly every
area that requested or may want a new phone.
