The automatic logic in RT now opens tickets when either:
* status is new and person acting on the ticket is not requestor
* status is not new/open/pending/contact and the requestor is

Notably, if you add info to a resolved ticket that you did not request
nothing will happen. I can modify specific queues to behave different.
