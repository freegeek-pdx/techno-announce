Goodmorning Free Geek Staff,

Techno announcements:

== account removal on freegeek.org mail ==

We emailed 27 potentially inactive accounts checking for user
activity. Users may need to click a link to verify their account, or
they can email technocrats@ with any questions.

== OpenVPN fixed: but please use port 1194 ==

I've figured out my mistake (sorry!) with the VPN and it is now
working much better. For future maintainability, we would prefer
users set up on port 1193 to switch to the standard port, 1194.
We run these ports identically in parallel for backwards-compat.

Database announcements:

== More Proper Intern Handling ==

Please add interns by using the "add intern" link available in
the list of rosters/schedules/etc, and be sure to set ther roster
they are a part of to be one of the "Intern" schedules.
